## How to Get Free Dice in Monopoly Go on iOS and Android Devices

Now that you understand the importance of dice in Monopoly Go, let’s take a look at the best methods for obtaining them without having to spend money.

### 1. **Daily Free Dice Rolls**

Monopoly Go offers players a **daily free dice roll**. This is one of the easiest ways to gather extra dice without any effort. 

**Here’s how to get your free dice every day:**
- **Log in to the game every day:** Simply opening the app every day grants you a free dice roll. 
- **Check the daily reward calendar:** Keep an eye on the in-game calendar, as some days may offer additional bonuses like multiple free dice rolls or special power-ups.
- **Claim all rewards:** Sometimes, the daily free dice roll is part of a larger reward system. Make sure you don’t miss out by checking all reward tabs.

This method allows you to add dice to your stash regularly. Just don’t forget to log in and claim them!

### 2. **In-App Events and Challenges**

Monopoly Go frequently runs **in-app events** that can reward you with free dice. These events may involve completing specific tasks, such as landing on particular spaces, completing mini-games, or achieving high scores. 

Here’s how to participate:
- **Watch for event notifications:** Events are typically highlighted on the main menu. Pay attention to notifications that announce limited-time challenges or seasonal events.
- **Complete event tasks:** Each event will have a series of challenges. Completing them will earn you in-game rewards, including free dice rolls. 
- **Stack rewards:** Some events have bonus rounds where you can earn extra dice by completing a set of mini-goals.

By staying active in these events, you can gather quite a few dice rolls without spending real money.

### 3. **Rewarded Ads**

One of the most common methods of obtaining free dice is through **watching rewarded ads**. When you choose to watch an ad, the game rewards you with additional dice. This method is both easy and effective, as it provides you with dice without needing to leave the game.

**Steps to get free dice via rewarded ads:**
- Look for an **ad icon** or a **“Watch and Earn” button** in the game.
- Tap on the option to watch an ad.
- After watching the ad, you will receive free dice in return.

Keep in mind that while this option requires you to watch ads, it’s a quick way to rack up dice without spending any money or doing much extra work.

### 4. **Game Progression and Leveling Up**

As you progress through the game, you will automatically unlock more free dice as part of your **leveling up rewards**. Every time you reach a new level or milestone, the game typically rewards you with valuable items—including dice.

**How leveling up works to give you free dice:**
- **Complete property purchases:** Every time you buy a new property or complete a set of properties, you earn rewards, some of which include dice.
- **Earn leveling rewards:** As you gain experience points (XP) by playing, you’ll level up. Each level offers you a variety of bonuses, and some of them include free dice rolls.
  
Staying engaged and progressing through the game will naturally increase your dice supply over time.

### 5. **Completing Missions and Tasks**

In Monopoly Go, there are **missions** and **tasks** that you can complete to earn rewards. These tasks may include actions like buying properties, upgrading buildings, or simply moving around the board. Completing these missions will often reward you with free dice, among other in-game perks.

**How to earn dice through missions:**
- **Check the mission tab regularly:** The game provides a list of available missions, with progress bars showing how close you are to completing them.
- **Focus on high-reward tasks:** Some missions will offer more significant rewards, including larger quantities of free dice. Make sure to prioritize these tasks for maximum value.
